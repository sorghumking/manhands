        <h3>Laws of Manhands</h3><br>

        <h5>Payouts (based on $100 entry fee)</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Manhands Bowl Champion: $800</li>
            <li>Manhands Bowl Runner-up: $200</li>
            <li>Regular Season Winner: $400</li>
          </ul>
        </h5><br>

        <h5>Keeper Eligibility</h5>
        <p>Managers may keep one player from their prior season's final roster <b>if</b> that player meets these eligibility requirements:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Player was kept (any round), or drafted in Round 4+ of the prior season's draft.</li>
          <li>Player was rostered the entire prior season (draft through Manhands Bowl). A traded player maintains eligibility.</li>
          <li>Player has been kept for less than three seasons.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Keeper Penalties</h5>
          <p>To keep a player, a manager must draft that player one (first year kept), two (second year kept), or three (third year kept) rounds earlier than their original draft position.
          <p><b>Example</b><br>Suppose Irv Smith Jr. is drafted in the 10th round of the 2021
            draft. If Irv remains rostered the entire season, he is keeper-eligible in 2022.
          <p>To keep Irv in 2022,
          a manager must use their 9th round pick (1-round penalty
          for the first year kept).
          <p>To keep Irv in 2023, a manager must use their 8th round pick (2-round penalty).
          <p>To keep Irv in 2024, a manager must use their 7th round pick (3-round penalty).
          <p>Irv cannot be kept by <b>anyone</b> (even if traded) in 2025, as he has reached the three-year keeper limit.</p>
